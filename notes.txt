-each track will NOT have its own sequencer
-there will be one sequencer
-drumMachine class will keep track of the currently selected drum cell
-when record mode is initiated, 
  •the drum-cell-indicator will illuminate for the active cells for the
   sound
  •when drum cells are clicked in record mode, they will patch the current 
   sound into the sequencer
  
  -have the ui file be a controller that links user interactions to 
   functions in the drumMachine


-write logic for the edit mode in ui.js in `mapSoundToCell`


-go through all the steps and check to see which have true values for the 
 currentSound, store the indices in an array
  •go over the array of indices and toggle an `armed` class for the ones that 
   are true
